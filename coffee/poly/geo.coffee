# Slow Canonicalization Algorithm
#
# This algorithm has some convergence problems, what really needs to be done is to
# sum the three forcing factors together as a conherent force and to use a half-decent
# integrator to make sure that it converges well as opposed to the current hack of
# ad-hoc stability multipliers.  Ideally one would implement a conjugate gradient
# descent or similar pretty thing.
#
# Only try to use this on convex polyhedra that have a chance of being canonicalized,
# otherwise it will probably blow up the geometry.  A much trickier / smarter seed-symmetry
# based geometrical regularizer should be used for fancier/weirder polyhedra.
